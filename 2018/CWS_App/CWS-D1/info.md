CWS - Welcome
-------------

I've had access to a majority of the NCAA D1 baseball data but really only studied the SEC or Texas A&M. This app is an effort to broaden the spectrum and allow others interested in different conferences/teams to also explore the data.

### Overview Page

This is a very basic comparision of teams records vs. their projected win %, [based on the pythagorean theorem](https://www.fangraphs.com/library/principles/expected-wins-and-losses/). You'll see an accompanying plot to see absolute run differential in each teams games. This is especially helpful to see if a team got lucky and won a lot of 1 run games or not. 

The bottom of the page just has raw standings. It's important to note since D1 teams have a sizeable non-conference schedule their Runs Scored and allowed might be inflated by playing non-conference opponents. Its most likely better to look at this with reference to conference games only. 

### Player Impact

This is personally my favorite section. So you've got two key plots here to look at. The consistency plots highlight 3 game rolling wOBA averages. wOBA is a much better measure for offense and helps identify some of the top hitters. You can look at these for individual teams or conferences as a whole. 

The second plot looks to capture player similarities. It does so by finding Offensive Player Grade [OPG](http://vixra.org/pdf/1205.0104v1.pdf), developed by Tung in 2012 for MLB players. From there, a clustering algorithm is run on the players to identify which players are most similar. OPG is nice because it reduces multiple offensive statistics (or dimensions) into one catch-all statistic. The higher the OPG, the better. 

### Additional Plots

There are just some plots I'm playing with. Feel free to drop some reccomendations, [@msubbaiah1](https://twitter.com/msubbaiah1)
